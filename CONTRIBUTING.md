## File an Issue

Before creating a new issue, please check if a similar one already exists.

If so, you can add your information as a comment to the existing issue.

### Report a Bug

Reporting bugs is a valuable way to contribute:

1. Open an issue that summarizes the bug.
2. Set the label to "bug".

### Suggest a Feature

To request a new feature:

1. Open an issue summarizing the desired functionality and its use case.

## Contribute Code, Documentation, and More

To contribute code, documentation, or other improvements:

1. Discuss your plans beforehand to ensure alignment with project goals.
2. Check the list of open issues. Assign yourself an existing issue or create a new one.
3. Follow project conventions for tests, code style, documentation, and commit messages.
4. Understand that contributions may be declined if they don't align with project guidelines or goals.
5. Familiarize yourself with the [Pull Request Lifecycle](#pull-request-lifecycle).
6. Agree to the "inbound=outbound" norm: your contributions will be under the same license as the project.
7. [Sign your commits](#dco---signoff-and-signing-a-commit).

## Issues and Pull Request Feedback

Project maintainers will do their best to review and respond to issues within five business days.

The quality of information in your issue or pull request will affect the feedback loop.

For non-trivial contributions, please discuss with the project team first.

**If the project is not listed as archived, it is maintained.**

## Pull Request Lifecycle

We use the [Fork-and-Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch from your fork's main branch.
3. Make your changes and run quality checks locally:

   ```bash
   just verify  # Run all quality verifications
   ```

   See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for details.
4. Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork.
5. Open a new pull request to the main project.
6. Respond to any feedback from project maintainers.

## Commit Guidelines

### DCO - Signoff and Signing a Commit

#### Signoff (DCO agree)

***A Signoff assures to the project that you have the right to contribute your content*** +

Add a signoff to your commit using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:

```console
git commit --signoff -m 'fix: add fix for superbug x'
```

#### Sign

***A Sign assures that the commit came from you***

Sign your commit with `-S` or `--gpg-sign`:

```shell
git commit --signoff --gpg-sign -m "fix: add fix for the bug"
```
