7. [Sign your commits](#dco---signoff-and-signing-a-commit).

## Issues and Pull Request Feedback

Project maintainers will do their best to review and respond to issues within five business days.

The quality of information in your issue or pull request will affect the feedback loop.

For non-trivial contributions, please discuss with the project team first.

## Pull Request Lifecycle

We use the [Fork-and-Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch from your fork's main branch.
3. Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork.
4. Open a new pull request to the main project.
5. Respond to any feedback from project maintainers.

## Commit Guidelines

***A Signoff assures to the project that you have the right to contribute your content*** +

Add a signoff to your commit using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:

```console
git commit --signoff -m 'fix: add fix for superbug x'
```

#### Sign

***A Sign assures that the commit came from you***

Sign your commit with `-S` or `--gpg-sign`:
